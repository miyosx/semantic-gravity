# Minimal Web Concepts - The Resilience of Memory

Ideas for conveying "a mind that resists forgetting" in minimal interactive form.

## 1. The Unkillable Sentence

A single sentence. Click any word to "erase" it. But:
- Erased words are replaced by synonyms
- Or the remaining words rearrange to preserve meaning
- You can never fully kill the sentence

```
"I love you"
   ↓ (click "love")
"I ████ you"
   ↓ (fades in)
"I adore you"
```

## 2. Palimpsest

Words are "erased" but bleed through underneath. Layer upon layer of deletions, all still faintly visible. The page becomes a ghost of everything you tried to forget.

---

## 3. The Reforming Word

One word in the center. Click it—it shatters into letters. The letters slowly drift back together. You can never keep it broken.

---

## 4. Network That Reroutes

Visual graph of connected words. Cut a connection (click a line). The network instantly finds another path—new lines appear. Knowledge routes around damage.

---

## 5. Strikethrough That Fails

```
T̶e̶c̶h̶n̶o̶l̶o̶g̶y̶ r̶e̶v̶e̶a̶l̶s̶ ̶t̶r̶u̶t̶h̶
```
Everything is struck through. But you can still read it. The erasure is visible but useless.

## 6. Two Words

Just this on a white page:

```
forget me
```

Click "forget"—it disappears. "me" remains.

Click "me"—"forget" returns.

They protect each other.

## Notes

These concepts emerged from testing embedding corruption on LLMs. Even with 78% of vocabulary corrupted, models remain coherent—finding synonyms, rerouting, confabulating. True forgetting is remarkably difficult.

The art isn't about successful erasure. It's about the persistence of meaning despite damage.
